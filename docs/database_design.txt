Database:
    - Will contain a set of securities which will each have order books and time and sales information for each timestamp

    - An orderbook (Book) for a given timestamp will have a set of bids and asks with each limit order containing the following information (some of which may be missing)
        order_id ~ a unique id for the order
        period ~ [A unique identifier for round number , will be zero unless exchange is RIT]
        tick ~ [A unix timestamp in seconds]
        trader_id ~ [Unique id for the trader (may not be included)]
        ticker ~ [The ticker symbol of the security (unique)]
        type ~ [Limit]
        quantity ~ [The amount being ordered]
        action ~ [BUY / SELL]
        price 
        quantity filled ~ [The amount of the order filled (may not be inlcuded)]
        vwap ~ [The volume weighted average price for the order]
        status ~ [ Open ]
    - Time and Sales (TAS) for a given timestamp will have a set of market orders
        id ~ a unique id for the transaction
        period ~ [A unique identifier for round number , will be zero unless exchange is RIT]
        tick ~ [A unix timestamp in seconds]
        ticker ~ [The ticker symbol of the security (unique)]
        quantity filled ~ [The amount sold]
        price 


So we need a couple of tables:

securities: 
    (PKEY) ticker ~ unique id
    exchange ~ The exchange (either RIT, or other)
    limit_order_rebate real,
    trading_fee real,
    quoted_decimals real,
    max_trade_size real,
    api_orders_per_second real,
    execution_delay_ms real,

book:
    (PKEY) order_id ~ a unique id for the order
    (PKEY) period_id ~ [A unique identifier for round number, will be zero unless exchange is RIT]
    (PKEY) tick ~ [A unix timestamp in seconds ~ note for RIT exchange this will start from 0]
    (PKEY) trader_id ~ [Unique id for the trader (may not be included, default is zero)]
    (PKEY, FORIEGN_KEY) ticker ~ [The ticker symbol of the security (unique)]
    quantity ~ [The amount being ordered]
    (PKEY) action ~ [BUY / SELL, limit is implicitly assumed]
    price 
    quantity filled ~ [The amount of the order filled (may not be inlcuded)]
    vwap ~ [The volume weighted average price for the order]

tas:
    (PKEY) market_id ~ a unique id for the transaction
    (PKEY) period_id ~ [A unique identifier for round number , will be zero unless exchange is RIT]
    (PKEY) tick ~ [A unix timestamp in seconds]
    (PKEY, FORIEGN_KEY) ticker ~ [The ticker symbol of the security (unique)]
    quantity ~ [The amount sold] 
    price
